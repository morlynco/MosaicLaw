# Review Process

We don't have one yet. 

Frankly, striking the right balance between allowing any and all changes in the spirit of democracy* and selectively approving changes that fit the mission is tough to do correctly. We expect the review process to change over time, and that's okay.

For now, we will comment on any and all merge request approvals/rejections describing why it was or was not approved to be added to the repo.
