# Guide to GitHub

### What is GitHub?

* **Definition:** GitHub is a web-based platform primarily used for version control. It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects, most commonly used in software development.
* **Key Feature:** It uses "Git," a version control system, for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among multiple people.

### Why Do We Use GitHub?

* **Collaboration:** GitHub makes it easy for anyone to contribute to your project, ensuring a collaborative environment
* **Transparency:** All changes and contributions are visible to everyone inolved, promoting transparency and accountability
* **Version Control:** It keeps a record of all changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed

### How to Make Changes?

1. **Create an Account:** Sign up for a free GitHub account
2. **Locate Project:** Navigate to the project's repository (repo) where the files are stored.
3. **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy (fork) of the repo. This allows you to experiment without affecting the original project.
4. **Make Changes:** Browse through the files and make changes. You can do this directly on GitHub's website by opening a file and clicking the "Edit" button.
5. **Committ Changes:** After making changes, commit them. This records your changes in your forked version of the repository.

### How is Your Change Approved?

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Once you're happy with your changes, you can submit a pull request. This is a request to the original repo to accept your changes.
2. **Review Process:** The project team will review your changes. Find our review process [here](/About/Review%20Process/README.md).
3. **Merge:** If your changes are approved, the maintainers will merge them into the main project. Your contributions are now part of the project!"

### Additional Tips

* **Explore and Learn:** Familiarize yourself with the GitHub interfact and explore different repositories to understand how they work.
* **Communicate:** Use issues and comments to ask questions or discuss changes with project maintainers and other contributors.
* **Stay Updated:** Watch the repository to receive notifications about new discussions and changes.

Remember, GitHub is a powerful tool for collaboration. Don't hestitate to contribute - your input, whether it's writing new legislation, modifying or adding sources to existing legislation, or adding to the wishlist, is valuable!
