# MosaicLaw
Legislation by the People and for the People.

## Objective
MosaicLaw is committed to advancing legislation that serves the best interests of the community. Our goal is to identify, develop, and support bills that benefit the public, targeting both ambitious, transformative policies and pragmatic 'low-hanging fruit' â€” easily passable legislation with immediate, positive impacts. This dual approach ensures we not only strive for significant, long-term change but also secure quick wins for immediate community benefit.

# How Can I Help?

Our community includes folks from all backgrounds, including: lawyers, policy experts, industry leaders, and regular folk that want to better the lives of those around them.
